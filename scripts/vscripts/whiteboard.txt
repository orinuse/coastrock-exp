/*****************************************************
	Collection of functions for switching a boss
	bot's loadout, which is handy for boss patterns
	or boss phases.
	
	Functions:
	1. OnGameEvent_post_inventory_application()
	  - Catches any spawned boss robots and appends them
	  into the "bossbots" array
	2. BossInit()
	  - Initialises the entities needed for the boss logic to work.
	3. RunBossLogic()
	  - Popfile function to start the boss logic
	  - Sets the amount of phases and patterns a boss will have.
	  
	Boss logic works according to these variables set by a `BossInit()` call: 
	1. Phases
	  - A phase is the loadout(s) a boss changes to when
	  enough health is lost.
	2. Patterns
	  - Patterns are loadouts the boss'll randomly change
	  to during each phase.
